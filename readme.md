this is a simple ipfs server

# Start

In order to start the server we need to first install ipfs globally, to get the jsipfs command

```bash
npm install -g ipfs
```

Then we need to config the server with basic settings for a proper start

```bash
npm run config:ipfs
npm run methods:ipfs
```

Then we can start the server

```bash
npm run start:ipfs
```
